### üîß Technical Implementation Details

#### Day-Specific Skeleton Architecture
```typescript
interface DaySpecificSkeleton {
  dayType: string;              // e.g., 'push', 'pull', 'legs'
  name: string;                 // e.g., 'Push Day', 'Pull Day'
  coreSlots: WorkoutSlot[];     // Essential exercises for this day type
  accessoryPool: WorkoutSlot[]; // Optional exercises for this day type
}
```

**Available Day Types**:
- **Push Day**: Horizontal press, vertical press, tricep extensions, lateral raises
- **Pull Day**: Horizontal pull, vertical pull, bicep curls, rear delt work  
- **Legs Day**: Squat, hinge patterns, lunges, calf raises

#### Enhanced GeneratedPlan Interface
```typescript
interface GeneratedPlan {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  image: string;
  templateId: string;
  volume: VolumeLevel;          // NEW: Preserved for level progression
  selectedEquipment: string[];  // NEW: Preserved for level progression
  levels: TrainingLevel[];      // Can contain multiple dynamically generated levels
}
```

#### Level Generation Logic
```typescript
export function generateNextLevel(
  currentPlan: GeneratedPlan,
  previousLevelExerciseIds: string[],
  volume?: VolumeLevel
): TrainingLevel | null {
  // Uses dayRotation to determine workout structure
  // Applies day-specific skeletons for each day type
  // Excludes previous level exercises for variety
  // Applies progressive overload (+1 set for all exercises)
  // Maintains equipment and volume consistency
}
```

### üéØ User Experience Enhancements

#### Dynamic Completion Modal
- **Plan Type Detection**: Automatically detects generated vs pre-made plans
- **Contextual Options**: Shows appropriate progression buttons based on plan type
- **Clear Messaging**: Different descriptions for automated vs manual progression
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during level generation process

#### Exercise Variety System
- **Intelligent Exclusion**: Prevents repetition of exercises from previous level
- **Movement Pattern Consistency**: Maintains workout structure while varying exercises
- **Equipment Respect**: Uses same equipment selection as original plan
- **Fallback Logic**: Graceful handling when exclusions limit exercise options

#### Progressive Overload
- **Automatic Advancement**: Increases sets for both core and accessory exercises
- **Volume Preservation**: Maintains user's original volume preference
- **Structured Progression**: Follows established training principles

### üìä Quality Assurance

#### Template Integrity Validation
- All existing templates updated with `dayRotation` arrays
- Day-specific skeletons created for all referenced day types
- Movement pattern consistency verified across all skeletons
- Exercise type compatibility ensured (compound/isolation)

#### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for missing templates or skeletons
- Graceful fallback when exercise exclusions limit options
- Detailed logging for debugging level generation issues
- User-friendly error messages for generation failures

#### State Management
