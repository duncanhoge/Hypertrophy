    - `editWeight`, `editReps`, `editDuration`: Store edited values
  - Implemented `handleEditSet()` function to initiate editing
  - Implemented `handleSaveEditedSet()` function with:
    - Input validation based on exercise type
    - Supabase database UPDATE operation
    - Local state synchronization
    - Trial mode support (local-only updates)

### üîß Technical Implementation Details

#### Edit Modal Architecture
```typescript
// State management for edit functionality
const [showEditSetModal, setShowEditSetModal] = useState(false);
const [editingSet, setEditingSet] = useState<any>(null);
const [editWeight, setEditWeight] = useState('');
const [editReps, setEditReps] = useState('');
const [editDuration, setEditDuration] = useState('');
```

#### Database Update Logic
```typescript
const handleSaveEditedSet = async () => {
  // Input validation based on exercise type
  // Supabase UPDATE operation
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('workout_logs')
    .update(updatedData)
    .eq('id', editingSet.id);
  
  // Local state synchronization
  setLoggedSetsForExercise(prev => 
    prev.map(log => 
      log.id === editingSet.id 
        ? { ...log, ...updatedData }
        : log
    )
  );
};
```

#### Interactive UI Enhancement
- Logged sets now display with hover effects and visual feedback
- Clear indication of interactivity with "Tap to edit" hint
- Smooth transitions and consistent styling
- Maintains accessibility standards

### üéØ User Experience Enhancements

#### Intuitive Interaction
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects clearly indicate clickable elements
- **Contextual Editing**: Modal shows only relevant input fields based on exercise type
- **Pre-populated Data**: All fields pre-filled with existing values for easy editing
- **Clear Actions**: Primary/secondary button hierarchy for save/cancel actions

#### Error Prevention
- **Input Validation**: Prevents invalid data entry (negative values, zero values)
- **Type-Specific Validation**: Different validation rules for different exercise types
- **Clear Error Messages**: User-friendly error messages for validation failures
- **Trial Mode Support**: Graceful handling of trial mode with local-only updates

#### Workflow Integration
- **Non-Disruptive**: Editing doesn't interrupt workout flow
- **Immediate Feedback**: Changes reflected instantly in the UI
- **State Preservation**: Current workout state maintained during editing
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling prevents data loss

### üìä Quality Assurance

#### Input Validation
- **Timed Exercises**: Duration must be positive integer
- **Rep-Based Exercises**: Reps must be positive integer
- **Weight Exercises**: Weight validation for positive numbers
- **Optional Fields**: Proper handling of optional weight inputs

#### Database Integrity
- **Atomic Updates**: Single database operation per edit
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for database failures
- **State Consistency**: Local state always synchronized with database
- **Trial Mode**: Proper isolation of trial mode from database operations

#### User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Modal works across all screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Visual Consistency**: Matches existing application design system
- **Loading States**: Proper handling of async operations

### üîÑ Edge Cases Handled

#### Data Validation
- **Empty Inputs**: Prevents saving with empty required fields
- **Invalid Numbers**: Validates numeric inputs for positive values
- **Type Mismatches**: Ensures data types match exercise requirements
- **Boundary Values**: Handles edge cases like very large or small numbers

#### System States
- **Trial Mode**: Local-only updates when in trial mode
- **Network Failures**: Graceful handling of database connection issues
- **Concurrent Edits**: Proper state management for multiple rapid edits
