# Plan Generation Architecture

## Overview

The Plan Generation system enables users to create personalized workout plans based on their goals, available equipment, and time preferences. This document outlines the complete architecture, including the Custom Plan Management & Volume Control features implemented in July 2025.

## Purpose

The Plan Generation Engine was created to:

1. **Personalize Training**: Generate workout plans tailored to individual equipment availability and goals
2. **Provide Flexibility**: Allow users to choose workout duration based on their schedule
3. **Enable Management**: Give users control over their custom plans with rename and delete functionality
4. **Control Volume**: Provide workout length options from short (30-40 min) to long (60+ min) sessions
4. **Support Progression**: Foundation for future features like automatic level advancement

## Architecture Components

### 1. Workout Templates

Templates serve as blueprints for plan generation, defining the structure and exercise requirements for complete training programs.

**Updated July 2025**: Templates now use a core/accessory slot structure for volume control.

#### Template Schema

```typescript
interface WorkoutTemplate {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  daysPerWeek: number;
  workouts: WorkoutSkeleton[];
}

interface WorkoutSkeleton {
  day: string;
  name: string;
  coreSlots: WorkoutSlot[];      // Essential exercises (always included)
  accessoryPool: WorkoutSlot[];  // Optional exercises (volume-dependent)
}

interface WorkoutSlot {
  slotId: string;
  movementPattern: string;
  slotType: 'compound' | 'isolation';
  targetSets: number;
  targetReps: string;
  exerciseType: 'weight_reps' | 'reps_only' | 'reps_only_with_optional_weight' | 'timed';
}
```

#### Core vs Accessory Structure

**New in July 2025**: Template structure updated to support volume control.

- **Core Slots**: Essential exercises that form the foundation of every workout (e.g., primary compound lifts)
- **Accessory Pool**: Optional isolation/accessory exercises selected based on volume preference

This structure ensures all generated workouts maintain proper exercise selection regardless of chosen duration.

### 2. Plan Generation Engine

**Enhanced July 2025**: Added volume control and improved plan management.

The engine (`src/lib/planGenerationEngine.ts`) handles the core logic for creating personalized plans.

#### Generation Process

1. **Template Selection**: User chooses training goal/template
2. **Volume Selection**: User selects workout length (Short/Standard/Long)
3. **Equipment Selection**: User specifies available equipment
4. **Plan Naming**: User customizes plan name (optional)
4. **Plan Generation**: Engine creates personalized plan based on selections

#### Volume Control Logic

```typescript
function getAccessoryCount(volume: VolumeLevel): number {
  switch (volume) {
    case 'short': return 1;     // ~30-40 minutes - Quick, efficient workouts
    case 'standard': return 2;  // ~45-55 minutes (default) - Balanced sessions
    case 'long': return 4;      // ~60+ minutes - Comprehensive training
  }
}
```

The engine always includes all core exercises and selects accessories based on volume preference.

### 3. Database Schema

**Updated July 2025**: Enhanced to support plan management features.

#### User Profiles Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  current_plan_id text,
  current_level_index integer DEFAULT 0,
  block_start_date timestamptz,
  block_duration_weeks integer DEFAULT 6,
  -- Enhanced JSONB structure supports custom naming and management
  active_generated_plan jsonb,  -- Stores complete generated plan
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Key Fields:**
- `active_generated_plan`: JSONB field storing the complete generated plan object
  - Now includes `name` field for custom plan naming
- `current_plan_id`: References either pre-made plan ID or template ID for generated plans
- Integration with existing training block system

### 4. Plan Generation Wizard

The wizard (`src/components/PlanGenerationWizard.tsx`) provides a step-by-step interface for plan creation.

**Enhanced July 2025**: Added volume selection step and plan naming.

#### Wizard Steps

1. **Template Selection**: Choose training goal
2. **Volume Selection**: Select workout length (NEW)
3. **Equipment Selection**: Specify available equipment
4. **Plan Generation**: Create and name the plan

**New Step**: Volume Selection
#### Volume Selection Step

- **UI**: Three clear options with duration estimates
- **Default**: Standard volume (45-55 minutes)
- **Visual**: Clock icons and descriptive text for each option

### 5. Custom Plan Management

**New in July 2025**: Complete plan management system.

#### Rename Functionality

- **Location**: Plan home screen (edit icon next to plan title)
- **Implementation**: Updates `active_generated_plan.name` in database
- **UI**: Modal with text input pre-filled with current name

#### Delete Functionality

- **Location**: Plan home screen (delete icon next to plan title)
- **Confirmation**: Required confirmation modal with clear warning
- **Implementation**: Sets `active_generated_plan` to null, clears related state

#### Plan Naming

- **Initial Naming**: Text input in final wizard step
- **Default Name**: Template-based (e.g., "My Full Body Hypertrophy")
- **Post-Creation**: Editable via rename functionality
- **Validation**: Name trimming and length validation

### 6. Integration with Existing Systems

#### Training Block System

Generated plans integrate seamlessly with the existing training block system:
- 6-week default duration
- Custom plan names displayed throughout the application
- Progress tracking
- Completion celebration
- Level progression support

#### Exercise Dictionary

Generated plans leverage the centralized exercise dictionary:
- Movement pattern matching
- Equipment filtering
- Exercise metadata
- Alternative exercise support

#### Workout Session

Generated plans work with the existing workout session interface:
- Exercise logging
- Rest timers
- Progress tracking
- History integration

## Technical Implementation

### Exercise Selection Algorithm

**Enhanced July 2025**: Improved filtering and selection logic.

```typescript
function selectExerciseForSlot(
  slot: WorkoutSlot, 
  selectedEquipment: string[], 
  excludeExerciseIds: string[]
): { id: string } | null {
  // Enhanced algorithm with better equipment filtering
  // 1. Filter by movement pattern
  // 2. Filter by exercise type (compound/isolation)
  // 3. Filter by equipment availability
  // 4. Filter out excluded exercises
  // 5. Random selection from candidates
}
```

### Volume-Based Exercise Selection

**New in July 2025**: Core feature for workout duration control.

```typescript
function selectAccessoryExercises(
  accessoryPool: WorkoutSlot[],
  selectedEquipment: string[],
  excludeExerciseIds: string[],
  count: number
): Exercise[] {
  // Volume-based selection from accessory pool
  // Filter accessories by equipment
  // Shuffle and select requested count
  // Ensure variety and equipment compatibility
}
```

### State Management

**Enhanced July 2025**: Added plan management functions.

The `useUserProfile` hook manages generated plan state:

```typescript
// Plan creation
const startGeneratedPlan = async (generatedPlan: any) => {
  return updateProfile({
    active_generated_plan: generatedPlan,
    current_plan_id: generatedPlan.templateId,
    current_level_index: 0,
    block_start_date: new Date().toISOString(),
    block_duration_weeks: 6
  });
};

// Plan management
const updateGeneratedPlanName = async (newName: string);
const deleteGeneratedPlan = async ();
```

**New Functions**:
const deleteGeneratedPlan = async ();
```

## Future Enhancements
