#### Exercise Types

The application supports three distinct exercise types, each with specific input requirements and user interactions:

##### 1. Weight & Reps Based (`weight_reps`)
- **Description**: Traditional strength training exercises that require both weight and repetition tracking
- **Input Fields**: 
  - Weight (required): Amount of weight lifted in lbs/kg
  - Reps (required): Number of repetitions performed
- **Examples**: Dumbbell Bench Press, Barbell Squats, Overhead Press
- **Usage**: User enters the weight used and reps completed for each set

##### 2. Repetition Based (`reps_only`, `reps_only_with_optional_weight`)
- **Description**: Bodyweight or rep-focused exercises, including AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible) exercises
- **Input Fields**:
  - Reps (required): Number of repetitions performed
  - Weight (optional): Additional weight if applicable (for `reps_only_with_optional_weight`)
- **Examples**: Push-ups, Pull-ups, Crunches, Weighted Dips
- **Usage**: 
  - For standard rep exercises: User enters reps completed
  - For AMRAP exercises: User enters "AMRAP" initially, then logs actual reps achieved via prompt
  - Optional weight can be added for exercises like weighted push-ups

##### 3. Timed Based (`timed`)
- **Description**: Duration-based exercises with integrated timer functionality and flexible input options
- **Input Fields**:
  - Duration (required): Target time in seconds
- **Enhanced Timer Features**:
  - **Start Stopwatch**: Interactive count-up timer with real-time display
  - **Manual Duration Entry**: Option to enter duration directly without using the stopwatch
  - **Flexible Workflow**: Users can use the stopwatch to time their exercise, then manually adjust the duration before logging
  - **Visual Progress**: Large, clear timer display with exercise name and target time reference
  - **Early Completion**: "End Set" option to stop timer before target time is reached
  - **Automatic Population**: Stopwatch results automatically populate the duration field for easy editing
- **User Flow**:
  1. **Start Stopwatch** (optional): Begin timing the exercise with visual feedback
  2. **End Set**: Stop the timer when exercise is complete (populates duration field)
  3. **Adjust Duration** (optional): Manually edit the duration field if needed
  4. **Log Set & Start Rest**: Record the set and begin rest period
- **Examples**: Plank, Wall Sit, Dead Hang
- **Usage**: Provides maximum flexibility - users can time exercises with the stopwatch for accuracy, or enter durations manually for convenience

### Plan Generation Architecture

The **Plan Generation Engine** creates personalized workout plans using a template-based system:

- **Templates**: Define workout structure with core and accessory exercise slots
- **Volume Control**: Adjusts workout length by varying accessory exercise count
- **Equipment Filtering**: Selects exercises based on available equipment
- **Exercise Dictionary Integration**: Leverages centralized exercise database
- **Plan Management**: Full CRUD operations for generated plans

#### Available Templates
- **Full Body Hypertrophy** (3 days/week) - Balanced full-body training
- **Push/Pull/Legs** (3 days/week) - Functional movement patterns
- **Hypertrophy Superset** (3 days/week) - Time-efficient high intensity
- **Upper/Lower Split** (4 days/week) - Classic frequency and volume balance
- **The Bodybuilder Split** (4 days/week) - Maximum isolation and volume

#### Volume Levels
- **Short**: 1 accessory exercise (~30-40 minutes)
- **Standard**: 2 accessory exercises (~45-55 minutes) - Default
- **Long**: 4 accessory exercises (~60+ minutes)

For detailed information about the Plan Generation system, see: [Plan Generation Documentation](docs/plan-generation.md)

For information about the template system and how to add new templates, see: [Workout Templates Documentation](docs/workout-templates.md)

### Exercise Dictionary Architecture

The application uses a **Centralized Exercise Dictionary** as the single source of truth for all exercise data. This architecture provides:

- **Maintainability**: Single location for all exercise definitions
- **Scalability**: Easy addition of new exercises and equipment types
- **Feature Enablement**: Foundation for advanced features like exercise substitutions
- **Data Consistency**: Eliminates duplication and ensures accuracy

For detailed information about the Exercise Dictionary, see: [Exercise Dictionary Documentation](docs/exercise-dictionary.md)

### Training Block System

The **Workout Count-Based Progression** system provides structured workout programs based on completed workouts:

- **Workout-Based Programs**: Target calculated as (workout days × multiplier) with user customization
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators showing workouts completed and remaining
- **Completion Celebration**: Success screens acknowledging user achievements
- **Flexible Management**: Settings panel for target adjustments and manual progress editing
- **Multi-Level Support**: Architecture ready for program progression
